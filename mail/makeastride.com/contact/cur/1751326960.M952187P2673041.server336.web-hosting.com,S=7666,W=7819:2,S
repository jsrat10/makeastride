Message: Hello Makeastride Administrator,

My name is Eric and, unlike many emails you may receive, I would like to provide you with a word of congratulations – well done!

What for?

Part of my job is to review websites, and the work you’ve done with Makeastride certainly stands out.

It’s clear you have taken building a website seriously and made a real investment of effort into making it top quality.

However, there is, indeed, a question…

So, when someone such as me stumbles upon your site – maybe at the top of the search results (great job, by the way) or just through a random link, how do you know?

More importantly, how do you make a connection with that person?

Studies show that 7 out of 10 visitors leave – they’re there one second and then gone.

Here’s a way to create immediate engagement that you may not have known about…

Web Visitors Into Leads is a software widget that works on your site, ready to gather any visitor’s Name, Email address, and Phone Number. It lets you know immediately that they’re interested – so that you can speak to that lead while they’re actually browsing Makeastride.

Please see this URL to experience a Live Demo with Web Visitors Into Leads now to see exactly how it works:  
https://trustedleadgeneration.com

It can be a significant improvement for your business – and it gets even better… once you’ve gathered their phone number, with our new SMS Text With Lead feature, you can immediately start a text conversation – right away (and there’s actually a notable difference between contacting someone within 5 minutes versus 30 minutes.)

Additionally, even if you don’t close a deal right away, you can follow up later on with text messages for new offers, content links, or just friendly notes to build a relationship.

Everything I’ve described is straightforward, user-friendly, and effective.

You could be converting significantly more leads today!

Eric
