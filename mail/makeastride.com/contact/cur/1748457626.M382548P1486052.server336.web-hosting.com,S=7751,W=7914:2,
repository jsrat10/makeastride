Message: Hello Makeastride,

I'm Eric and I recently discovered your website - Makeastride - in the search results.

This is what that means to me…

Your SEO’s working.

You’re receiving eyeballs – at least mine.

Your content’s pretty good, would not change a thing.

BUT…

Eyeballs do not pay the bills.

CUSTOMERS do pay the bills.

And studies show that 7 out of 10 visitors like Makeastride will drop by, have a look, and then leave without doing anything else.

It’s like they never even were there.

You can fix this.

You can make it extremely easy for them to show interest, say, okay, let’s talk without needing them to even pull their phone from their pocket… thanks to Web Visitors Into Leads.

Web Visitors Into Leads is a software widget that sits on your website, ready and waiting to capture any visitor’s Name, Email address, and Phone Number. It allows you know immediately – so you can speak with that lead immediately… before they leave.

Please visit the following URL to experience a Live Demo with Web Visitors Into Leads now to see precisely how it works and even give it a try… it could be huge for your business: https://trustedleadgeneration.com

Time is of the essence when it comes to connecting with leads – the difference between contacting someone within 5 minutes compared to 30 minutes implies you can be converting up to 100X more leads now!

Moreover, now that you’ve got their phone number, with our new SMS Text With Lead feature, you can instantly start a text (SMS) conversation immediately… which is so effective, because connecting with someone within the first 5 minutes is 100 times more efficient than waiting 30 minutes or more later.

The new text messaging feature lets you follow up frequently with new offers, content links, even just follow-up notes to develop a relationship.

Everything I’ve just described is very easy to implement, cost-effective, and beneficial.
