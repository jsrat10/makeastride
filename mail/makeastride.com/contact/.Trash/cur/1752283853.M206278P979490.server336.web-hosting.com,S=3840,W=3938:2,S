Hi Nigel,

Thank you for reaching out. Iâ€™d be happy to learn more and explore how 
we might work together.

Could you please share a bit more about your company, your current 
needs, and what kind of support or services you're looking for? That 
will help me better prepare for a productive discussion.

Looking forward to hearing from you!
Thank you
Jo
