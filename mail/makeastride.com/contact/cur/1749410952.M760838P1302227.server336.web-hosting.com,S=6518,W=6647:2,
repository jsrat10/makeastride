Message: Hello to the Makeastride Owner,

My name’s Eric, and I recently came across your site, Makeastride, while browsing online. Your site showed up near the top of the search results, so whatever you’re doing for visibility seems effective.

If I may ask: after someone like me finds Makeastride, what typically happens?

Is your site generating valuable inquiries for your business?

Many visitors view a website and then leave without taking the next step. Research suggests that a majority of visitors exit quickly, leaving no contact information.

Consider this idea: What if there was a straightforward way for each visitor to indicate they’d like a call from you right when they arrive?

You can make this happen.

Web Visitor is a tool that works on your site, ready to securely gather a visitor’s name, email, and phone number. It alerts you immediately, so you can speak with that person while they are still viewing your site.

Please visit:

to see a live demonstration of Web Visitor and observe precisely how it works.

Acting promptly matters when it comes to building connections. The difference between engaging with someone within a few minutes, versus waiting longer, can be substantial.

Our new SMS Text With Lead feature allows you to begin a text conversation as soon as you have their number. Even if they aren’t ready right now, you can keep in touch with updates, offers, and helpful information.

Please visit the link above to learn what Web Visitor can do for your business. You might be surprised at how much more interest you can capture.

Eric
