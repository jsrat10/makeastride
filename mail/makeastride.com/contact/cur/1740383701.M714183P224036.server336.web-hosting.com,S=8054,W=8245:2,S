Message: Hi Makeastride,

Let’s face it—most marketing strategies today are ineffective, leaving business owners frustrated and wondering where all their money went. 

Here’s the truth: Traditional marketing doesn’t work anymore. It’s about time to shift to direct-response marketing, the proven strategy that generates results in the real world.

Dan Kennedy, one of the leading marketing experts, swears by direct-response marketing, and his strategies have helped thousands of business owners grow their brands. 

Let me show you how to apply it to your business.

Step 1: Know Your Target Audience

Targeting everyone is a huge mistake. You must define your ideal customer. Direct-response marketing requires you to speak directly to a specific group of people.

Example 1:
Target Audience: Busy professionals

Offer: “Quick and effective workout plans for busy professionals.”

This specific focus allows businesses to craft marketing messages that truly resonate.

Example 2:
Target Audience: Aspiring entrepreneurs

Offer: “The ultimate guide to start your e-commerce store in 30 days—no prior experience required.”

This appeals directly to the desires of this niche, making the marketing message much stronger.

Step 2: Clear and Compelling Offer

A great product is only as good as the offer. The offer should solve a problem and make it impossible for your ideal customer to say no.

Example 1:
A fitness coach offered: “Sign up for my program today and receive a free 1-hour coaching session, valued at $300.” This added value made the offer irresistible.

Example 2:
An e-commerce store offered: “Free shipping on all orders over $50, plus a free product with every purchase.” The free bonus added to the deal makes it more attractive.

Step 3: Track Everything

If you’re not measuring, you’re guessing. The most successful marketers track their results religiously.

Example 1:
A car dealership tested their email campaigns and found that subject lines with specific car models drove a 25% higher open rate than generic ones.

Example 2:
A SaaS company split their traffic between two landing pages: one with a video and one with text. The video version converted 40% more visitors into paying customers.

Your Action Step:
Start tracking your marketing results—whether it’s email opens, clicks, or conversions. If you don’t track, you can’t improve.

Tomorrow, we’ll dive into crafting irresistible offers and how to create something your customers can’t say no to.

To your success,
Kevin
