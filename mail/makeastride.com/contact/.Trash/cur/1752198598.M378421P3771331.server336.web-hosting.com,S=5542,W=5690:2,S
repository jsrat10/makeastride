Hi Natadha,

Thank you for reaching out and for your kind words about my website.

I’m open to learning more about the ad opportunities you’re offering. 
Before moving forward, could you please share additional details, such 
as:

A list of some of the premium advertisers you work with

Typical eCPM ranges and payment terms

How the integration process works

Any examples or case studies from sites similar to mine

Looking forward to your response.

Regards,
Jo
