Message: Hi Jyothi, Congratulations on your latest venture!

I went through your website and ‘Make a Stride’ looks like an interesting platform. It’s also nice to see you are connected to my VP Mike Watson.

I am reaching out to you as I think we have an opportunity to collaborate. Jeavio helps VC/PE backed startups by being strategic partners with skin in the game. We also offer AI Engineering Services which includes Consulting on your AI strategy, Product Delivery, and staff augmentation. In short, we can meet you wherever you are at in your AI journey.

Our CEO Yash Shah is a member of TiE Global and has extensive experience working with start-ups and entrepreneurs. Our CTO Rushi Luhar brings over 8 years of AI-focused engineering experience.

We would like to learn more on your startup and how we can help. Please let me know if I can set up an introductory call.

Regards,
Shubhadeep
