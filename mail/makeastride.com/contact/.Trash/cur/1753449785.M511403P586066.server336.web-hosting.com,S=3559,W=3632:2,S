Message: Ever stop to think how much you're spending on marked-up CPMs for Connected TV ads?
If you're using “premium” audience segments without verifying who you're actually reaching, that money is likely feeding someone else's family.
No pressure. Here’s the site if you're open to see a revolutionary vision for digital advertising
