Message: Hello Makeastride Administrator,

My name is Eric, and I just found your site Makeastride. It’s got a lot to offer, but here’s a suggestion to make it even better.

Web Visitors Into Leads – see the live demo now:  
https://trustedleadgeneration.com

Web Visitors Into Leads is a software widget that works on your site, ready to gather any visitor’s Name, Email address, and Phone Number. It alerts you the moment they inform you they’re interested – so that you can talk to that lead while they’re actually browsing your site.

Once you’ve gathered their phone number, with our new SMS Text With Lead feature, you can promptly start a text conversation. Even if they don’t agree on your offer then, you can follow up with text messages for new offers, content links, or even just friendly notes to build a relationship.

The difference between contacting someone within 5 minutes versus waiting longer means you can be converting significantly more leads now!

Eric  
PS: Studies show that 70% of a site’s visitors leave and are gone for good after just a moment. Don’t keep missing out on them.  
Web Visitors Into Leads offers a complimentary 14-day trial – it even includes International calling.  
You have customers ready to talk with you right now… don’t keep them waiting.
