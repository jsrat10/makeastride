Message: Hello to the Makeastride Owner. This is Eric and I noticed Makeastride a short time ago.

It appears well structured… now what?

What I mean is, when someone like me discovers your website – either through a search or just browsing around – what happens next? Are you receiving meaningful inquiries from your site, or enough to meet your needs?

Honestly, most business websites come up a bit short when it comes to attracting engaged visitors. Research indicates that 70% of a site’s visitors leave and never return after only a moment.

Here is an idea…

What about making it simple for each visitor who arrives to receive a direct phone call from you as soon as they reach your site…

This is possible –

Web Visitors Into Leads is a tool that operates on your site, designed to collect each visitor’s name, email address, and phone number. It notifies you the moment they indicate interest – so that you can speak to that person while they are browsing your site.

Please visit https://actionleadgeneration.com to view a live demonstration of Web Visitors Into Leads and understand how it operates.

You will notice a significant difference between connecting with someone within 5 minutes compared to a half-hour or more later. This can greatly improve the likelihood of meaningful engagement.

It becomes even more helpful. After you have their phone number, with our SMS text communication feature, you can promptly begin a text conversation.

That way, even if you do not reach a conclusion immediately, you can stay connected through text messages for informational updates, content links, or simple check-in notes to establish a relationship.

Quite helpful.

Please visit https://actionleadgeneration.com to learn how Web Visitors Into Leads can support your business.

You can potentially connect with many more interested individuals as soon as possible.

Eric

PS: Web Visitors Into Leads provides a no-cost 14-day evaluation period. It also supports international communication. There are interested individuals ready to speak with you now, so please do not delay.
